# Bun Rules

## Package Manager Preference

**Always use Bun instead of npm/pnpm/node** for all package management and script execution tasks in this project.

### Commands to Use

- **Package Installation**: Use `bun install` (or `bun i`) instead of `npm install` or `pnpm install`
- **Adding Dependencies**: Use `bun add <package>` (or `bun a <package>`) instead of `npm install <package>` or `pnpm add <package>`
- **Adding Dev Dependencies**: Use `bun add -d <package>` instead of `npm install --save-dev <package>` or `pnpm add -D <package>`
- **Script Execution**: Use `bun run <script>` or `bun <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- **Package Removal**: Use `bun remove <package>` (or `bun rm <package>`) instead of `npm uninstall <package>` or `pnpm remove <package>`
- **Execute Package Binaries**: Use `bun x <package>` (or `bunx <package>`) instead of `npx <package>` or `pnpm exec <package>`
- **Running Tests**: Use `bun test` instead of `npm test` or `pnpm test`

### Project Configuration

This project uses Bun as evidenced by:
- The presence of [bun.lockb](mdc:bun.lockb) (lockfile)
- The [package.json](mdc:package.json) is configured for bun usage

### Examples

```bash
# ✅ Correct - Use bun
bun install          # or: bun i
bun add react        # or: bun a react
bun add -d typescript
bun run dev
bun run build
bun dev              # Also valid - bun can run scripts directly
bun x vite           # Execute package binaries (or: bunx vite)
bun test             # Run tests

# ❌ Incorrect - Don't use npm/pnpm/node
npm install
npm install react
npm install --save-dev typescript
npm run dev
npm run build
npx vite
pnpm install
pnpm add react
pnpm run dev
pnpm exec vite
node scripts/build.js
```

## Auto-fix After File Changes

After creating, editing, or modifying any files in the codebase, you MUST run `bun run fix` to ensure code quality and consistency.

### When to apply this rule
- After creating new files
- After editing existing files
- After modifying any source code
- After making changes to configuration files
- After any code generation or refactoring

### Implementation
1. Complete your file creation/modification tasks
2. Run the command: `bun run fix`
3. Address any issues that arise from the fix command
4. Confirm the fix was successful

### Example workflow
```bash
# After making changes to files
bun run fix
```

### Important notes
- Ensures consistent code formatting and linting
- Catches potential issues early
- Maintains code quality standards across the project
- Should be run even for minor changes to maintain consistency

### Exceptions
- Only skip this step if the user explicitly requests not to run it
- If `bun run fix` fails, report the error and ask for guidance
